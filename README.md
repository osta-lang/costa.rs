# Osta Programming Language

Osta is the systems programming language for flexibility, performance, security, and runtime guaranteesâ€”based on Rust
while incorporating features inspired by Zig and C3, targeting C's legendary flexibility and performance, with a
powerful type system that treats types as first-class citizens, enabling dependent types, linear types, and
Turing-complete meta-compilation to manipulate code or types at compile time using Osta itself.

## Features

- **First-Class Types**: Types are values that can be manipulated at runtime and compile time.
- **Dependent Types**: Ensure correctness by making types depend on values.
- **Linear Types**: Guarantee resource management without garbage collection.
- **Meta-Compilation**: Write Osta code to transform your program during compilation.
- **C Compatibility**: Seamless interoperability with existing C codebases.
- **Modern Syntax**: Borrowed from Rust, Zig, and C3 for improved safety and expressiveness.

## Status

The Osta compiler is in its early development stages.
Currently, there are no methods available to compile or run Osta programs.
The syntax is subject to frequent changes as the language evolves.
